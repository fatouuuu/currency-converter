# Currency Converter

Welcome to the Currency Converter repository! This repository is for Moringa School's Phase 1 project. This is a simple single-page application that allows you to convert between different currencies using current exchange rates.

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- Node.js
- The request library, which can be installed using npm install request

## Usage

To use the currency converter, navigate to the root directory of this repository and run the following command:

``` javascript
node main.js
```

You will be prompted to enter the amount of money you want to convert, the currency you want to convert from, and the currency you want to convert to. For example:

```markdown
Enter the amount of money you want to convert: 100
Enter the currency you want to convert from: USD
Enter the currency you want to convert to: EUR
```

The program will then output the equivalent amount in the desired currency, based on the current exchange rate.
